      @element vector
      @cardinality 0..*
      @summary Identifies a matching vector which should be used for probabilistic matching
      @attribute {decimal} m The probability that a record where this vector matches is an actual match
      @attribute {decimal} u The uncertainty measure, where this vector will match by pure coincidence
      @attribute {enum} whenNull When the source record's property is null, how should this vector be treated
      @attribute {boolean} required Indicates that this vector MUST fully match or else the entire match is considered false
      @attribute {enum} weightMode For string based vectors, indicates whether outcome of this measure should be the full weight or based on the difference/similarity of the string functions
      @attribute {string} property The name or path to the property this vector is measuring
      @description
      The m and u values can be calculated as follows:
        (u) Take the probability that a person has the same week DOB and is not a match u=(1/52 = 0.019)
        (m) Estimate the probability that pairs will definately match (perfect data is 1.0) this is an estimation. A 95% chance would be represented as m=0.95
        
       The algorithm will then calculate:
       u(match) = 0.019
       m(match) = 0.95
       u(non-match) = 0.981
       m(non-match) = 0.05
       
       f(match) = m(match)/u(match) = 50  << Frequency ratio of matches based on week of birth
       f(non-match) = m(non-match)/u(non-match) = 0.0509
       
       weight for matches: ln(f(match))/ln(2) = 5.64385
       weight for non-matches: ln(f(non-match))/ln(2) = -4.2961
       
       Please note that you can specify either u and m or matchWeight and nonMatchWeight but not both sets
